XOR-ROM:

Generates a logic lookup table of N N-bit values. Data is stored in the connections between gates.
Gate count does not currently include decoder gates.
Max storage size is in theory 1MB, but the game cannot spawn this from the lift.
Max bit width is 64-bit.

To use:
Replace blueprint file path with the blueprint you wish to overwrite.
Include the "\\blueprint.json" at the end.
Run the python program, and specify your lookup table.
Currently a random table is generated.
Support to load a table from a CSV will be added.
